# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple **rule-based chatbot** built in Python that replies to user inputs using predefined rules. It uses basic `if-else` statements and string matching techniques to simulate a conversation. This project is great for beginners learning natural language processing (NLP) and Python basics.
